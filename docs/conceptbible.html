    <pre>EXHIBIT A: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A-1: Overview of Order in the Court
A-1.1a - [Order in the Court (OitC) is an MMO legal simulation where players progress through four phases: Defendant, Paralegal, Attorney, and Judge.]
A-1.1b - [The game blends real legal procedure with structured AI assistance via Sidebar, enabling players to learn, practice, and master legal reasoning through authentic gameplay loops.]
A-1.1c - [OitC is a realism-first, AI-assisted legal MMO where players operate inside an authentic, systemic legal ecosystem rather than a scripted story.]
A-1.1d - [Players experience the fantasy of operating as real legal professionals—with agency, accountability, and long-term mastery over their careers and influence.]

A-2: Core Philosophy
A-2.1a - [OitC is built on three pillars of intellectual property and experience design: Sidebar, the IRL Law Library, and The Brand.]
A-2.1b - [Sidebar drives gameplay; the IRL Law Library supplies authoritative grounding; The Brand defines tone, presentation, identity, and immersion.]

A-3: Design Philosophy
A-3.1a - [Order in the Court is built on authenticity, player agency, and real-world legal procedure. Every mechanic must support realism without creating artificial grind or manufactured work.]
A-3.1b - [Systems lean on the player-driven ecosystem rather than direct developer intervention, using RS, CS, and IS as natural regulators.]

EXHIBIT B: INTRODUCTION

B-1: Purpose of the Concept Bible
B-1.1a - [This document defines the core systems, structures, and philosophies that govern Order in the Court. It is the internal blueprint for gameplay, progression, server architecture, and identity.]
B-1.1b - [It is not a pitch deck; instead, it establishes the immovable rules and design boundaries guiding all development.]

B-2: Checks & Balances System
B-2.1a - [RS (Reputation Score) represents professional competence, ethics, and reliability.]
AND
B-2.1b - [CS (Connection Score) measures interpersonal professional history, collaboration, and mutual trust between specific players.]
AND
B-2.1c - [IS (Insight Score) measures accumulated legal understanding and effective Sidebar interaction.]
B-2.2a - [These systems form a self-correcting ecosystem, rewarding professional conduct and penalizing misconduct without developer micromanagement.]
B-2.2b - [Mental model: RS governs capability, CS governs relationships, IS governs understanding.]
B-2.3a - [Server resets, splits, or merges are handled through explicit transfer rules; by default, RS/CS/IS are non-transferable across servers except through defined transfer events, which must be documented as SYSTEMS or EXPANSION HOOKS.]

B-3: Player Agency and Consequence Principle
B-3.1a - [All meaningful gameplay actions create persistent records influencing RS, CS, and IS.]
B-3.1b - [No system may erase or override player choices without procedural justification consistent with real-world legal logic.]
B-3.1c - [FIXED RULE – No system in this Concept Bible may require ongoing manual human micromanagement to function at scale; oversight and moderation loops must be automatable and sustainable.]

B-4: Classification of Rules
B-4.1a - [FIXED RULE – Defines core identity. Cannot be altered without breaking the game’s foundation.]
B-4.1b - [SYSTEM – Tunable mechanic subject to iteration and balancing.]
B-4.1c - [EXPANSION HOOK – Planned mechanic not yet implemented, included for future compatibility.]

B-5: Downstream Use of This Concept Bible
B-5.1a - [This Concept Bible is the canonical source for all design, technical, narrative, and pitch materials. Any derivative document must either comply with it or explicitly mark deviations for review.]
B-5.1b - [Once adopted, CB-v9.4 supersedes CB-v9.3 for all future development while preserving earlier versions as archival references.]

EXHIBIT C: THE THREE PILLARS

C-1: Sidebar (Gameplay Pillar)
C-1.1a - [Sidebar is the primary gameplay interface, providing translation, guidance, research assistance, and structured legal reasoning.]
C-1.1b - [Sidebar empowers players while preserving agency. It explains, suggests, and teaches but does not act independently on behalf of the player.]
C-1.1c - [Sidebar creates the interactive feel of OitC, shaping pacing, tone, understanding, and player workflow.]
C-1.1e - [Sidebar is the sole gameplay interface for OitC; all filings, calendars, evidence views, messaging, and instructional content are experienced through Sidebar.]
C-1.1d - [Sidebar uses the Judicial Rules Engine (JRE) as a backend adjudication tool, applying probability-modified and rule-bound outcomes. The JRE supports Sidebar but is not a standalone system or identity element.]
C-1.2a - [Sidebar may never impersonate a player, independently accept or reject in-game obligations, or make strategic choices without explicit player input.]
C-1.2b - [Sidebar must decline requests that would break role boundaries, confidentiality rules, or Oversight protocols, and must instead instruct the player on proper procedure.]

C-2: Law Pillar
C-2.1a - [The Law Pillar consists of two layers: the IRL Law Library (IRLLL) and the In-Game Law Library (IGLL). IRLLL is a proprietary Andyland corpus accessed only by MARL0; IGLL is the studio-owned in-game corpus used by all player Sidebars.]
C-2.1b - [Player Sidebars never query IRLLL directly. All doctrine, precedent, and procedural rules shown to players are drawn from IGLL.]
C-2.1c - [Both IRLLL and IGLL are developed progressively through gameplay; only legal areas actually invoked by players are constructed, reviewed, and integrated into the in-game legal system.]
C-2.1d - [When gameplay exposes a legal issue for which IGLL contains no controlling doctrine, the issue is forwarded to MARL0 so that the relevant IRLLL material can be constructed or updated and an IGLL change can be proposed.]
C-2.1e - [Only human SCOTUS justices may approve changes to IGLL based on MARL0’s proposals. In addition, binding in-game precedent created through judicial decisions may refine or expand IGLL.]
C-2.1f - [This structure preserves human control over the in-game body of law while allowing MARL0 to reduce human grind-work by preparing advisory material for SCOTUS review.]
C-2.1g - [Within IGLL, “binding precedent” refers to a decision designated as controlling for a defined jurisdictional scope and level of court; decisions may be distinguished when materially different facts or controlling higher-court authority apply.]
C-2.1h - [By default, simulated-judge decisions carry the same doctrinal weight as human-judge decisions for their jurisdiction and level, unless flagged, overturned, or superseded through appellate review or SCOTUS action.]
C-2.1i - [SCOTUS may issue non-precedential or advisory opinions that guide Sidebar behavior and lower-court reasoning without formally entering IGLL doctrine.]
C-2.1j - [IGLL supports judge-initiated Precedent Challenges via the Judicial Precedent Challenge (JPC) system, allowing existing precedents to be re-litigated under defined rules.]

C-3: The Brand (Identity & Marketing Pillar)
C-3.1a - [The Brand represents the proprietary Willard/MARL0 creative identity governing tone, voice, UI feel, aesthetic rules, realism boundaries, and all player-facing material.]
C-3.1b - [The Brand ensures OitC maintains a distinct immersive character—grounded, modern, and non-cartoonish—and avoids drifting into generic simulation or roleplay environments.]
C-3.1c - [The Brand is a pillar because it defines the experiential identity of OitC, influencing pitch materials, trailers, MARL0 appearances, and the overall atmosphere of the game.]
C-3.2a - [Forbidden aesthetics include cartoon UIs, neon arcade palettes, medieval parchment motifs, anime courtroom parody, and over-the-top meme styling that undermines realism.]
C-3.2b - [Required tone includes clean, modern typography; professional, subdued palettes; grounded visual framing; realistic environments; and continuity of tone across all roles and servers.]
C-3.3a - [Douglas Willard, Esq. is the creator’s in-game character and canonical avatar, serving as a recurring narrative anchor in certain systems (such as bootstrap case generation) without granting mechanical advantages unavailable to other players.]
C-3.3b - [MARL0 functions both as the parent Sidebar model and as the only system with direct access to the IRL Law Library, supporting IGLL updates and specialized systems such as bootstrap case generation and the JPC queue.]

EXHIBIT D: CORE GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS

D-0: High-Level Caseflow Loop
D-0.1a - [The standard caseflow loop is: Filing → Response → Motions → Hearings → Resolution → Appeal.]
D-0.1b - [Each stage provides opportunities to gain RS, build CS, and earn IS through research, preparation, advocacy, and collaboration.]
D-0.1c - [All matters begin as unrendered Case Profiles—skeletal case definitions created by the system. As attorney assignment and server demand require, these Case Profiles are expanded into fully Rendered Cases made available for play.]
D-0.1d - [Textual diagram: Case Profile → Rendered Case → Filing → Response → Motions → Hearings → Resolution → Appeal.]
D-0.1e - [The transition from Case Profile to Rendered Case is triggered by a combination of attorney assignment, player demand, and server caseload thresholds.]

D-0.2: Server Bootstrap Caseflow
D-0.2a - [At initial server launch, OitC uses a bootstrap caseflow to seed paralegal and attorney roles before organic player-versus-player demand is sufficient.]
D-0.2b - [During bootstrap, MARL0 selects appropriate Case Profiles and expands them into Rendered Cases with Douglas Willard, Esq. listed as Attorney of Record so that paralegals can gain RS, CS, and IS through real work on system-supplied matters.]
D-0.2c - [As players qualify for attorney roles and firm infrastructures mature, new matters are increasingly assigned to human attorneys instead of the Willard bootstrap pipeline.]
D-0.2d - [Bootstrap case generation winds down as natural caseflow becomes dominant; beyond this phase, no new manufactured cases are created except where explicitly allowed under the “No Manufactured Work” exceptions in Exhibit G.]

D-1: Phase 1 – Defendant

D-1.0: Phase Purpose
D-1.0a - [The Defendant Phase teaches fundamentals, introduces Sidebar, and filters unserious or bad-faith players before they enter the professional ecosystem.]

D-1.1: Onboarding and Scenario Design
D-1.1a - [Players enter pre-written flawed cases designed to teach critical thinking and identify procedural or factual defects.]
D-1.1b - [Sidebar establishes tone and trust, guiding players through the legal world without overwhelming them.]

D-1.2: Representation Choice
D-1.2a - [Pro Se defendants may purchase Insight Packs; Public Defender representation includes PPP paralegals and PD attorneys; Private Attorneys may be selected manually or assigned from eligible players.]
D-1.2b - [Representation is flexible within realistic limits and may shift as the case develops.]

D-1.3: Appeals Introduction
D-1.3a - [Phase 1 appeals introduce appellate mechanics lightly, preparing players for deeper systems later.]
D-1.3b - [More advanced appellate gameplay emerges in the Attorney and Judge phases.]

D-1.4: Pretrial Status, Progression, and Exceptions
D-1.4a - [Bail, bond, or pretrial release may be represented in simplified form as access limits, time pressure, or stakes, but remains primarily a narrative and structural device rather than a grind mechanic.]
D-1.4b - [Players may be disqualified from progressing out of the Defendant Phase for repeated bad-faith conduct, refusal to engage with Sidebar, or failure to complete required tutorial matters.]
D-1.4c - [Phase 1 tutorial-style defendant cases are a defined exception to the “No Manufactured Work” rule; all ongoing server-level work outside these contexts must originate from real player actions and disputes, except for the bootstrap and fallback exceptions in Exhibit G.]

D-2: Phase 2 – Paralegal

D-2.0: Phase Purpose
D-2.0a - [Paralegals form the organizational and social backbone of the MMO, experiencing the workflow that prepares them for attorney roles.]

D-2.1: Transition to Professional Play
D-2.1a - [Players enter professional work in PPP firms or PSP offices.]
D-2.1b - [They may freely explore both sides to understand different career paths.]

D-2.2: Role Identity
D-2.2a - [Paralegals draft filings, prepare motions, organize evidence, and ensure procedural compliance.]
D-2.2b - [They form the connective tissue between Sidebar’s explanations and attorney strategy.]

D-2.3: Social MMO Integration
D-2.3a - [Paralegal performance generates early RS and CS.]
D-2.3b - [Players establish reputations and form relationships that impact long-term careers.]

D-2.4: Automation Rules
D-2.4a - [Paralegal Sidebars are never used for automation. Their work must come from real players to preserve role identity and accountability.]
AND
D-2.4b - [Attorney Sidebar may auto-generate minimal compliance filings to avoid procedural defaults only.]
D-2.4c - [If a Paralegal has prepared and submitted a draft filing to the attorney and the attorney fails to file by the deadline, Sidebar may submit the Paralegal’s draft to prevent a procedural default.]
D-2.4d - [If neither Paralegal nor attorney has prepared a draft, Sidebar may generate the minimal required filing to avoid procedural failure, without conferring substantive strategic advantage.]
D-2.4e - [Minimal compliance filings are strictly limited in length and complexity and may not contain substantive strategy, narrative, or argumentation.]

D-2.5: Court-Appointed Advocates (CAA)
D-2.5a - [Within the PPP track, eligible Paralegals may certify as Court-Appointed Advocates (CAAs), allowing them to handle limited Municipal Court matters under supervision.]
D-2.5b - [Paralegals may not sign filings or act as counsel of record; all filings must flow through attorneys or structured CAA mechanisms defined by the studio.]
D-2.5c - [CAA work is supervised by designated attorneys or PSP offices with limits on concurrent active cases and matter types to preserve quality and progression balance.]
D-2.5d - [Paralegal performance contributes quantitatively to RS through accurate, timely work and to CS through repeated collaboration with specific attorneys or offices.]

D-3: Phase 3 – Attorney

D-3.0: Phase Purpose
D-3.0a - [The Attorney Phase is the core adversarial stage where gameplay becomes fully dynamic and player-driven.]

D-3.1: PPP Attorney Track
D-3.1a - [PPP attorneys represent clients, draft filings, argue hearings, and build firm prestige.]
D-3.1b - [RS and CS influence career opportunities, case difficulty, and firm advancement.]

D-3.2: PSP Attorney Track
D-3.2a - [PSP attorneys prosecute cases, evaluate filings for defects, and enforce constitutional and procedural compliance.]
D-3.2b - [Ethical walls prevent inappropriate cross-role interactions, especially involving Oversight or impeachment contexts.]

D-3.3: Case Tools
D-3.3a - [Attorneys unlock calendars, drafting tools, dashboards, and broader authority over case strategy.]
D-3.3b - [Attorneys form the core of adversarial gameplay, connecting defendant experience to judicial review.]

D-3.4: Automation Limits and Conflicts
D-3.4a - [Substantive strategy, arguments, and key narrative portions of filings may not be auto-generated; automation is confined to minimal procedural compliance.]
D-3.4b - [Conflict-of-interest triggers for attorney reassignment include prior representation of opposed parties, alt-account overlap with judges, or RS/CS patterns indicating potential abuse.]
D-3.4c - [Attorney specialization (e.g., criminal vs. future civil, municipal vs. appellate) is expected to emerge over time and may be supported as an EXPANSION HOOK.]

D-4: Phase 4 – Judge

D-4.0: Phase Purpose
D-4.0a - [Judges resolve disputes, stabilize legal standards, and create precedent influencing the entire server.]

D-4.1: Eligibility
D-4.1a - [Judges require high RS, strong CS endorsements, and a clean PSP-compatible record.]
D-4.1b - [Judges represent the highest trust roles in the ecosystem.]

D-4.2: Judicial Mechanics
D-4.2a - [Judges write opinions, manage dockets, and issue rulings.]
D-4.2b - [Their decisions influence Sidebar’s interpretations and unify legal standards across the server.]

D-4.3: High Court Server
D-4.3a - [The High Court server handles appellate and precedent-setting matters, focusing on questions of law rather than raw fact disputes.]
D-4.3b - [It ensures consistent interpretations across all active servers.]

D-4.4: Caseload, Removal, and Simulated Transitions
D-4.4a - [Judicial roles include caseload and docket management guidelines; judges may decline or defer new matters above thresholds to preserve quality and avoid burnout gameplay.]
D-4.4b - [Impeachment or removal from the bench may be triggered by patterns of abuse, RS/CS trends, Oversight findings, or other defined misconduct metrics.]
D-4.4c - [Simulated judge decisions remain valid precedent when a human judge is seated, but may be flagged for review and re-evaluated on appeal or through systems such as JPC.]

D-4.5: Judicial Precedent Challenge (JPC) System
D-4.5a - [The Judicial Precedent Challenge (JPC) system allows newly appointed judges to request review of precedent-setting cases that previously crossed the bench they now occupy.]
D-4.5b - [Eligibility: a judge may nominate a case for JPC if (1) the case was precedent-setting in IGLL, and (2) the case crossed the judge’s current bench at any point in its lifecycle, regardless of who occupied the seat at the time.]
D-4.5c - [When nominated, the underlying case remains closed until a firm accepts the challenge. For captioning purposes, the nominating judge is listed as Plaintiff-Appellant and the State (or equivalent) remains Appellee.]
D-4.5d - [Example caption: “The Hon. [Judge Name] v. State of [Jurisdiction]”.]
D-4.5e - [Once nominated, the case profile enters MARL0’s Precedent Challenge Queue. The queue is publicly visible, but attorneys only see cases for which they are qualified.]
D-4.5f - [Precedent Challenge matters function as high-prestige, high-stakes appellate work and are treated as standard appellate cases once accepted.]
D-4.5g - [Only a Managing Partner may accept a JPC on behalf of a firm. Upon acceptance, the case becomes open and proceeds as a standard appellate matter under existing appeal rules.]
D-4.5h - [The nominating judge may withdraw their challenge at any time before a firm accepts the case, removing it from MARL0’s queue with no penalty.]
D-4.5i - [If a JPC remains unaccepted by the end of the nominating judge’s term, the judge incurs a small RS penalty and minor Community Standing penalties from affected players; no penalties apply if the challenge is withdrawn before timeout.]
D-4.5j - [The JPC system encourages strategic legal maneuvering by judges, creates high-prestige opportunities for elite firms, and enables long-term evolution of server jurisprudence.]

EXHIBIT E: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

E-1: Server Model
E-1.1a - [OitC launches with a single unified server to ensure critical mass and shared precedent.]
E-1.1b - [Up to 12 servers may be added as population grows, each supporting transfer events and circuit specialization.]
E-1.2a - [The initial unified server targets a defined range of concurrent players and active cases (to be specified with the studio) to guide technical planning and capacity decisions.]
E-1.2b - [Additional servers are created or merged based on metrics such as caseload thresholds, queue times, RS/CS distribution, and regional demand.]
E-1.3a - [Each court type supports a placeholder judicial mode in which a simulated judge instance may be activated when no qualified human judge is seated and caseflow would otherwise stall.]
E-1.3b - [Placeholder judges share the same JRE and IGLL inputs as human judges but are constrained to matter types and authority levels defined in Exhibit G.]
E-1.3c - [When a human judge is appointed to a court, new matters are routed to the human judge; placeholder instances are used only as a fallback and should be phased out wherever sustainable.]

E-2: AI Behavior (Sidebar)
E-2.1a - [Sidebar handles all player-facing reasoning, explanations, filing assistance, and procedural checks.]
E-2.1b - [Sidebar respects confidentiality boundaries and does not leak privileged information across roles or cases.]
E-2.2a - [Sidebar models and prompt-logic may be updated on defined cadences; all players on a server share a consistent Sidebar version during live play.]
E-2.2b - [Sidebar updates should be tested in staging or with canary users or test servers before rollout to avoid destabilizing live caseflow.]

E-3: Judicial Rules Engine (Backend System)
E-3.1a - [The JRE is the backend adjudication tool used by Sidebar to mechanically process outcomes, rule validations, timing, and probability-modified results.]
E-3.1b - [The JRE has no player-facing role; all communication and interpretation comes from Sidebar.]
E-3.1c - [The JRE is infrastructure, not a pillar, and may be replaced or refactored without affecting player identity or branding.]
E-3.2a - [JRE updates follow a defined cadence and require regression testing against known case outcomes before going live.]
E-3.2b - [Rollback rules define when a JRE update may be reverted and how to treat cases decided under the reverted logic, to preserve fairness and clarity.]

E-4: Data Architecture & Storage Model

E-4.0 – Purpose (Fixed Rule)
E-4.0a – [The Data Architecture defines which information is stored locally, which information is server-authoritative, and how all gameplay-critical systems maintain integrity, privacy, and fairness.]
E-4.0b – [No client device may be trusted with gameplay-critical data. All authoritative records, scores, decisions, filings, and evidence reside on secure server infrastructure.]
E-4.0c – [Local storage, when used, is limited to performance optimization and temporary Sidebar memory. Local storage may never contain outcomes, RS/CS/IS data, case states, or authoritative legal documents.]

E-4.1 – Local vs Server Data Rules (Fixed Rule)
E-4.1a – [Server systems hold all authoritative legal data, including IGLL, case records, evidence, RS/CS/IS, JRE versions, and judicial decisions.]
E-4.1b – [Client devices may only store ephemeral, non-authoritative data such as UI preferences, download caches, or temporary Sidebar memory packs.]
E-4.1c – [All authoritative actions must be executed server-side. Client-submitted timestamps, filings, or score changes are rejected automatically.]
E-4.1d – [If discrepancies occur between client and server data, the server state always prevails.]

E-4.2 – Sidebar Memory and Local Caching Rules
E-4.2a – [Sidebar may store short-term session memory locally for pacing and conversational continuity, but this data is non-authoritative and may be cleared without impact to gameplay.]
E-4.2b – [Sidebar may not store privileged transcripts, case evidence, RS/CS/IS, judicial decisions, or other sensitive materials locally.]
E-4.2c – [Sidebar syncs with the server at session start to retrieve permissions, IGLL updates, and JRE versions. Version mismatches prevent gameplay.]
E-4.2d – [Sidebar memory packs store only conversational refinements. They do not store doctrinal logic, legal outcomes, or strategic data.]

E-4.3 – RS, CS, and IS Storage and Integrity
E-4.3a – [RS, CS, and IS exist only on the server in immutable, tamper-resistant form.]
E-4.3b – [RS changes are recorded as append-only event entries, including timestamps and case references.]
E-4.3c – [CS is stored as a server-level relationship graph. CS edges cannot be edited by players or Sidebars.]
E-4.3d – [IS is calculated server-side based on learning events and Sidebar performance, preventing local manipulation.]
E-4.3e – [Players may view summaries of their RS, CS, and IS but not raw internal logs.]

E-4.4 – Case Storage, Evidence, and Filing Persistence
E-4.4a – [All case records, filings, evidence, transcripts, and rulings are stored server-side and tied to unique Case IDs.]
E-4.4b – [Evidence is stored in server-hosted repositories; Sidebar retrieves only the portions required for authorized tasks.]
E-4.4c – [Clients may temporarily cache evidence for performance but cannot modify it. Integrity checks run automatically.]
E-4.4d – [Draft filings may exist locally but become authoritative only after server submission, at which point they are hashed.]
E-4.4e – [All stored filings include metadata such as author role, timestamp, jurisdiction, and representation context.]
E-4.4f – [Case histories persist permanently to support precedent, JPC, Oversight, and appellate review.]

E-4.5 – Oversight Partition and Restricted Data Access
E-4.5a – [Oversight operates in a segregated server partition inaccessible to PPP roles or general Sidebars.]
E-4.5b – [Only authorized PSP roles and MARL0 may access Oversight systems.]
E-4.5c – [PSP Sidebar logs are stored as append-only records. Log deletions become archival states rather than removals.]
E-4.5d – [Oversight data is encrypted at rest and in transit. No client device may store Oversight information.]
E-4.5e – [Oversight investigations generate persistent audit trails.]

E-4.6 – JRE Distribution and Version Sync
E-4.6a – [The JRE is versioned, server-authoritative, and globally applied to all logic affecting procedure or outcomes.]
E-4.6b – [Clients must sync to the current JRE version before participating in hearings, filings, or Sidebar interactions.]
E-4.6c – [Case IDs retain references to the JRE version in use at time of decision, ensuring post-update consistency.]
E-4.6d – [JRE rollback is possible. Cases affected by logic changes may be flagged for review.]

E-4.7 – Placeholder Judges and AI Judicial Storage
E-4.7a – [Placeholder judges operate server-side and apply the same JRE logic as human judges, within restricted parameters.]
E-4.7b – [AI judicial decisions are stored in the same permanent case chain as human rulings, with metadata indicating AI authorship.]
E-4.7c – [AI judges cannot set new precedent unless jurisdictional rules allow it.]
E-4.7d – [When a human judge assumes a bench, new matters are routed to that judge immediately. Placeholder judges deactivate automatically.]
E-4.7e – [AI decisions may be appealed or challenged through the Judicial Precedent Challenge system.]

E-4.8 – Anti-Tamper and Client Restrictions
E-4.8a – [Client devices may not generate authoritative timestamps, modify filings after submission, or fabricate case events.]
E-4.8b – [Sidebar must rely on server-delivered IGLL and JRE logic, not local data, for all legal reasoning.]
E-4.8c – [Local drafts must pass server validation for formatting, jurisdiction checks, and privilege compliance.]
E-4.8d – [Modifying local game files to influence outcomes results in automated enforcement consequences.]

E-4.9 – Server Split, Merge, and Recovery Rules
E-4.9a – [Server splits occur under defined conditions; RS, CS, and IS are copied server-side to prevent divergence.]
E-4.9b – [Case histories, precedent chains, and IGLL remain unified unless intentionally forked by SCOTUS-level directive.]
E-4.9c – [Sidebar versions remain consistent across server transitions.]
E-4.9d – [Redundant storage protects case and precedent data across availability zones.]
E-4.9e – [Server merges reconcile duplicate cases based on timestamps, jurisdiction, and SCOTUS directives.]


EXHIBIT F: MONETIZATION PHILOSOPHY

F-1: Fair Play
F-1.1a - [OitC avoids pay-to-win mechanics entirely; no purchase may alter legal outcomes.]
F-1.1b - [Insight Packs may accelerate understanding but never grant hidden mechanical advantages.]
F-1.2a - [No purchase, subscription, or paid item may modify outcome probabilities, JRE calculations, or judicial decision weight.]
F-1.2b - [Insight Packs may unlock guided scenarios, additional explanations, or structured learning modules but may not alter RS, CS, IS directly or indirectly improve outcome odds.]
F-1.2c - [Banned monetization patterns include loot boxes that affect case outcomes, “priority justice” queues that distort fairness, and pay-to-avoid-sanctions mechanics.]

EXHIBIT G: SCALABILITY & EXPANSION

G-1: No Manufactured Work
G-1.1a - [By default, courts do not generate artificial cases; all ongoing server-level activity should originate from real players, their disputes, and their professional actions.]
G-1.1b - [FIXED RULE – Manufactured work is prohibited except for three categories: (1) tutorial defendant matters in Phase 1, (2) server bootstrap cases generated via Douglas Willard, Esq. and MARL0 when attorney supply is insufficient, and (3) limited simulated-judge fallback necessary to prevent systemic stall when no human judge is available.]
G-1.1c - [These exceptions exist to teach core mechanics, seed the professional ecosystem, and preserve continuity; they are tightly scoped and should not expand into general-purpose grind systems.]
G-1.1d - [Outside these defined exceptions, all ongoing server-level work must originate from real player actions and disputes.]

G-2: Court Continuity Rule
G-2.2a - [When a court has no seated human judge, limited simulated judicial processes may operate to keep caseflow moving and prevent bottlenecks.]
G-2.2b - [Simulated judicial decisions and opinions are part of the in-game record and may create precedent unless and until they are modified or overturned through normal appellate processes.]
G-2.2c - [Once a human judge is seated, new matters are routed to that judge. Existing simulated rulings remain in force as case history and IGLL doctrine unless changed.]
G-2.2d - [AI/simulated judges are limited to defined matter types such as routine motions and defaults; precedent-setting questions, sanctions, or Oversight matters must wait for human judges.]
G-2.2e - [Players retain full rights to challenge AI-issued rulings via normal appellate pathways.]
G-2.2f - [Simulated decisions may be flagged for review when human judges arrive, including through mechanisms such as JPC.]

G-3: Anti-Abuse Safeguards
G-3.1a - [Multi-account collusion, RS/CS farming, and other coordinated exploits are prohibited and subject to in-world and system-level consequences.]
G-3.1b - [Automated drafting is limited to minimal compliance filings; all substantive advocacy must come from real players.]
G-3.1c - [Judge/attorney alt conflicts are restricted to prevent undue influence over both sides of a case or court.]
G-3.1d - [Sidebar data-sharing occurs only through approved channels that respect role boundaries, privacy requirements, and Oversight protocols.]
G-3.2a - [Anti-smurfing rules protect against repeated fresh-account cycling through the Defendant Phase to farm RS/CS or manipulate cases.]
G-3.2b - [Server-wide restrictions discourage controlling both bench and counsel roles in the same jurisdictional cluster, beyond normal conflict-of-interest rules.]
G-3.2c - [Anti-abuse tooling should follow transparency and fairness principles, avoiding opaque “shadow bans” or unreviewable penalties wherever possible.]

EXHIBIT H: CONCLUSION

H-1: Future Development Notes
H-1.1a - [Sidebar versioning and memory-pack systems are under consideration as future R&D efforts and are treated as Expansion Hooks rather than live systems.]
H-1.1b - [Civil Law expansion, additional court types, and MARL0 cameo requirements remain part of the long-term planning horizon.]
H-1.2a - [Internal roadmap – Stage 1: Core Loop Prototype (defendant-to-appeal caseflow).]
H-1.2b - [Internal roadmap – Stage 2: Sidebar Prototype (UI, guidance, and basic research loops).]
H-1.2c - [Internal roadmap – Stage 3: Case Generation & JRE Prototype; Stage 4: Sharding / High Court integration.]

H-2: Open Design Questions
H-2.1a - [Jury integration: which case types, at what scale, and with what mechanics should juries be implemented.]

I-1.1e - [IS – Insight Score; a measure of accumulated legal understanding and effective use of Sidebar.]
I-1.1f - [Insight Packs – Optional learning expansions that accelerate understanding but do not alter core mechanics or outcomes.]
I-1.1g - [Sidebar – The in-game AI assistant that provides legal translation, guidance, and research support within strict role and confidentiality limits.]
I-1.1h - [Judicial Rules Engine (JRE) – The backend rules and outcome processor that Sidebar uses to resolve procedural checks, timing, and probability-modified results. It is infrastructure, not a pillar.]
I-1.1i - [Sidebar Versioning – A future memory-pack concept where a player’s Sidebar behavior is influenced by locally stored past interactions, treated as an Expansion Hook.]
I-1.1j - [Checks & Balances – The combined effect of RS, CS, IS, and procedural design that keeps the ecosystem self-correcting and resistant to abuse.]
I-1.1k - [IRL Law Library (IRLLL) – A structured legal corpus proprietary to Andyland and accessed only by MARL0. It serves as an upstream reference when constructing or revising in-game doctrine.]
I-1.1l - [In-Game Law Library (IGLL) – The studio-owned in-game legal corpus containing doctrine, precedent, and procedural rules used by all player Sidebars. IGLL evolves through in-game precedent and SCOTUS-approved updates.]
I-1.1m - [Case Profile – A skeletal, unrendered case definition created by the system before being expanded into a playable matter.]
I-1.1n - [Rendered Case – A fully realized, playable case generated from a Case Profile based on attorney assignment and server demand.]
I-1.1o - [Professional Action – Any in-game act performed in a professional role (paralegal, attorney, judge, prosecutor) that can influence RS, CS, or IS.]
I-1.1p - [Oversight Case – A structured matter that investigates alleged misconduct or systemic abuse within the legal ecosystem, often involving logs from PSP Sidebars and simulated judges.]
I-1.1q - [Oversight Body – The in-world institution or panel responsible for handling Oversight Cases, impeachment-style investigations, and related accountability mechanisms.]
I-1.1r - [Simulated Judge – An AI- or system-driven judicial actor used when no human judge is seated, constrained to defined matter types and fully appealable.]
I-1.1s - [Human Judge – A player-controlled judge with full role responsibilities, subject to RS/CS-based eligibility, Oversight, and removal mechanics.]
I-1.1t - [Non-Precedential Opinion – An opinion that does not enter IGLL as binding doctrine but may still influence Sidebar guidance, judicial reasoning, or future design decisions.]
