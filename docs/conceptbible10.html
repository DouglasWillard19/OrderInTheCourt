Order in the Court - Concept Bible

<details>
<summary>FOREWORD – Conceptual Scope & Development Role</summary>
This Concept Bible is intended to communicate the conceptual framework, systemic philosophy, and continuity boundaries of Order in the Court. It is not a production specification, a finalized technical design, or a locked implementation plan. Rather, it is a map of intent—describing how the world, systems, and roles of the game are meant to relate to one another at a foundational level.

The ideas presented here are deliberately structural rather than prescriptive. They are meant to give experienced developers, designers, and engineers a clear understanding of what must remain coherent as the game evolves, while leaving ample room for iteration, optimization, and alternative implementations. This document assumes that the studio entrusted with building Order in the Court knows what it is doing, and it is written with respect for that expertise.

Where questions arise—whether technical, systemic, or narrative—they are not only expected but welcomed. I am happy to discuss any aspect of this Concept Bible in detail. The purpose of those conversations is not to enforce rigidity, but to help resolve continuity questions, preserve the underlying philosophy, and ensure that the game remains internally consistent as it grows.

During development, my intended role within the studio is that of Chief Justice. In this capacity, I serve as the steward of the game’s conceptual framework: its legal logic, systemic coherence, and narrative continuity. I am available to interpret this document, clarify intent, and help navigate design decisions that touch on the core identity of the project.

That role, however, is advisory by design. While this Concept Bible reflects my voice and authority at the conceptual level, the Chief Justice does not possess decision-making power over production, implementation, scheduling, or final design choices unless explicitly invited to do so. Final authority rests with the studio and its designated leadership.

Order in the Court is meant to be built collaboratively—balancing a strong, coherent vision with the practical realities and creative insights of the development team. This Concept Bible exists to support that collaboration, not to constrain it.
