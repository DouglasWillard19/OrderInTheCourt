Order in the Court - Concept Bible

<details>
<summary>FOREWORD – Conceptual Scope & Development Role</summary>
This Concept Bible is intended to communicate the conceptual framework, systemic philosophy, and continuity boundaries of Order in the Court. It is not a production specification, a finalized technical design, or a locked implementation plan. Rather, it is a map of intent—describing how the world, systems, and roles of the game are meant to relate to one another at a foundational level.

The ideas presented here are deliberately structural rather than prescriptive. They are meant to give experienced developers, designers, and engineers a clear understanding of what must remain coherent as the game evolves, while leaving ample room for iteration, optimization, and alternative implementations. This document assumes that the studio entrusted with building Order in the Court knows what it is doing, and it is written with respect for that expertise.

Where questions arise—whether technical, systemic, or narrative—they are not only expected but welcomed. I am happy to discuss any aspect of this Concept Bible in detail. The purpose of those conversations is not to enforce rigidity, but to help resolve continuity questions, preserve the underlying philosophy, and ensure that the game remains internally consistent as it grows.

During development, my intended role within the studio is that of Chief Justice. In this capacity, I serve as the steward of the game’s conceptual framework: its legal logic, systemic coherence, and narrative continuity. I am available to interpret this document, clarify intent, and help navigate design decisions that touch on the core identity of the project.

That role, however, is advisory by design. While this Concept Bible reflects my voice and authority at the conceptual level, the Chief Justice does not possess decision-making power over production, implementation, scheduling, or final design choices unless explicitly invited to do so. Final authority rests with the studio and its designated leadership.

Order in the Court is meant to be built collaboratively—balancing a strong, coherent vision with the practical realities and creative insights of the development team. This Concept Bible exists to support that collaboration, not to constrain it.

<summary>EXHIBIT D – Gameplay Structure & Case Lifecycle</summary>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-1: Purpose of Gameplay Structure</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-1.1: Cases as the Source of Formal Consequence - [Cases constitute the mechanism through which formal legal outcomes are produced within Order in the Court. All authoritative results—judgments, rulings, and dispositions—are generated through case resolution. Reputation Score (RS) movement derives exclusively from case outcomes, establishing cases as the sole formal record of professional success or failure within the legal system.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-1.2: Effects of Cases on Checks & Balances (C&B) - [Participation in cases produces effects across the Checks & Balances system. Case activity influences Reputation Score (RS), Community Standing (CS), and Insight (IS) as a collective framework governing professional stability and differentiation. The structure, enforcement, and balancing behavior of C&B are defined in a dedicated exhibit.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-1.3: Insight Presence - [Insight functions as a system influencing gameplay capability through Sidebar. Insight affects the depth, scope, and quality of information Sidebar may surface during case participation. Insight operates independently of formal authority, rank, or role eligibility, and its full behavior and development are defined elsewhere in this Concept Bible.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-1.4: Case Outcomes and Professional Standing - [Reputation Score (RS) responds directly to case outcomes, reflecting formal success or failure. Community Standing (CS) develops through interaction, conduct, and collaboration within cases and may evolve independently of verdicts or rulings. Together, RS and CS record how players are judged by the legal ecosystem over time.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-1.5: Integrated Gameplay Perspective - [Gameplay in Order in the Court emerges from the interaction of cases, professional standing, Sidebar capability, and role-based authority. Cases provide the formal structure through which legal consequence is expressed, while social, organizational, and institutional dynamics operate within and alongside that structure without prescriptive constraint.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-2: Cases as the Organizing Spine</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-2.1: Cases as Persistent Legal Objects - [Cases are durable legal entities that carry facts, law, procedural posture, participants, and outcomes. A single case may be accessed and worked by multiple players across different roles and at different times. Cases persist across sessions, resets, and role changes in a manner analogous to real-world legal matters, maintaining continuity independent of individual participation.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-2.2: Case-Centered Legal Activity - [Cases function as the locus of formal legal consequence within Order in the Court. Judgments, rulings, obligations, and enforceable authority are all exercised through case participation. While cases anchor formal legal outcomes, social, organizational, and institutional dynamics operate alongside case activity without being constrained or prescribed by it.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-2.3: Case Continuity Across Roles and Turnover - [A single case may involve different players at different points in its lifecycle. Role transitions occur within the lifespan of cases rather than resetting them. Cases remain active and coherent despite player turnover, with system mechanisms preserving continuity when human roles are vacated.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-2.4: Live Hearings & Judicial Pressure - [Live hearings exist as inherent, unscheduled possibilities within active cases. Hearings are expressions of judicial discretion rather than scheduled appointments. Eligibility for live hearings may be visible to involved players, signaling risk and encouraging preparation and task prioritization. Live hearings may compel immediate participation by multiple roles; presence is advantageous but not mandatory. When players are absent, prepared casework informs Sidebar-mediated representation. The persistent possibility of live hearings functions as a primary source of psychological and strategic pressure within cases, shaping player behavior and engagement.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-3: Case Profiles</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-3.1: Purpose of Case Profiles - [Case Profiles are skeletal representations of potential legal matters. They are non-playable, non-docketed, and carry no authority or enforceable consequence. Case Profiles exist as preparatory constructs rather than active cases.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-3.2: Case Profile Composition - [Case Profiles contain minimal factual summaries, jurisdictional indicators, and legal hooks sufficient to support future case creation. They do not include assigned participants, obligations, or procedural posture. The level of detail contained within Case Profiles remains subject to studio discretion.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-3.3: Relationship to Active Cases - [Case Profiles exist solely to support the creation of future cases. Transition from a Case Profile to a formal case is contingent on downstream eligibility, demand, and human action. Case Profiles have no independent gameplay consequence until accepted and transformed through court intake.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-4: Case Profile Queue</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-4.1: Purpose of the Case Profile Queue - [The Case Profile Queue functions as the managed intake pipeline for Case Profiles. It serves as an ordering and validation mechanism that stages potential matters for future creation. The queue is system-facing rather than player-facing.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-4.2: Intake and Validation - [Sidebar routes case intake requests into the Case Profile Queue. Within the queue, Case Profiles are validated for jurisdictional scope, eligibility, and system readiness. Validation operates as a prerequisite to case creation rather than a guarantee of activation.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-4.3: MARL0 Participation - [MARL0 participates in structuring and preparing Case Profiles while they reside in the queue. MARL0’s involvement is scoped, task-specific, and non-discretionary. MARL0 does not activate cases or independently generate authoritative legal matters.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-4.4: Queue Outcomes - [Case Profiles remain queued until activation criteria are met. Progression through the queue is driven by demand and eligibility rather than time alone. Management of queue behavior, prioritization, and pacing remains within studio discretion.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-5: Case Creation & Attorney of Record (AoR) Gating</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-5.1: AoR Entry as Case Creation Trigger - [A Case Profile transitions toward formal case creation only when an Attorney of Record is entered. AoR entry functions as a required human action that enables court intake. AoR designation may represent different forms of representation, including firm attorneys, supervisory partners, PSP assignments, or bootstrap placeholders.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-5.2: Court Intake and Authority Attachment - [Legal authority attaches upon court acceptance of a submitted Case Profile with an entered AoR. Court assignment establishes jurisdiction, enforceability, and procedural authority. Upon acceptance, the court assembles the Full Case File through backend systems.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-5.3: Full Case File Formation - [The Full Case File is the authoritative legal record created by the court. It includes facts, procedural posture, parties, representation, and contextual information necessary for adjudication. Full Case Files persist regardless of whether a case is open or closed.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-5.4: Docket Population and Obligation Generation - [Creation of a Full Case File triggers docket population. Docket items are generated by the court and assigned to appropriate roles based on jurisdiction and posture. Professional obligations flow from court authority rather than firm-side automation.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-5.5: Representation Anchoring - [AoR designation anchors legal representation within the Full Case File. AoR entry enables participation by additional roles, including paralegals, prosecutors, clerks, and judges. Representation handling remains flexible across firm and institutional contexts.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-5.6: Judicial Organization of Proceedings - [Procedural organization of a case is governed by judicial authority. Judges, supported by clerks and Sidebar, direct hearings, posture, scheduling, and procedural flow. PSP clerk roles serve as the experiential pathway for learning case organization and procedural management. Insight capability supports judicial organization by enabling Sidebar to manage administrative and scheduling functions. Continuance motions are available through normal motion practice, including during live hearings, and carry associated RS and CS effects.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-5.7: Human-Gated Case Creation - [Creation of a Full Case File is gated by human action through AoR entry. Human gating preserves legal coherence and authority integrity. Automation supports intake, validation, and assembly without originating authority.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-5.8: Demand-Driven Creation and Bootstrapping - [New case creation responds to unmet demand. Demand arises when players have available capacity without docketed work. Bootstrapping functions as a mechanism to satisfy demand when human-generated cases are insufficient and withdraws as demand normalizes.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-5.9: Creation Flexibility and Studio Discretion - [Methods for evaluating demand and triggering case creation remain subject to studio discretion. Thresholds may be determined through formulas or heuristics defined by the studio. Exhibit D establishes structural intent rather than numerical rules.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-6: Caseflow Loop</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-6.1: Canonical Legal Rhythm - [Cases progress through a recognizable legal rhythm that includes filing, response, motions, hearings, resolution, and appeal. This rhythm represents the evolution of legal posture over time rather than a mandatory or linear sequence of gameplay steps. Caseflow reflects legal structure and doctrine, not task ordering.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-6.2: Conditional Progression - [Not all cases traverse every stage of the caseflow loop. Dismissal, settlement, early resolution, or withdrawal represent complete and valid outcomes. Case progression responds dynamically to filings, rulings, and party action rather than following a predetermined path.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-6.3: Role Interaction Within Caseflow - [Different roles become relevant at different procedural postures. Participation is posture-dependent and contextual rather than static, allowing roles to enter or recede as cases evolve. Role engagement models remain flexible and subject to studio definition across case types.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-6.4: Caseflow and Checks & Balances (C&B) - [Participation within caseflow produces effects across the Checks & Balances system. Reputation Score (RS), Community Standing (CS), and Insight (IS) are influenced by engagement, outcomes, and conduct within cases rather than by completion of specific stages. Metric definitions and calculations are addressed in their dedicated exhibits.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-7: Docket Population</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-7.1: Automatic Docket Assignment - [Active cases are automatically added to relevant dockets based on role and jurisdiction. Docket population is institution- and role-driven rather than player-selected. Docket entries persist until reassignment or case closure.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-7.2: Scope of Dockets - [Dockets function as authoritative lists of active professional obligations. Separate but interconnected dockets exist for firms, offices, and courts, collectively forming the operational surface through which responsibility is expressed.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-7.3: Multi-Role Visibility - [Cases may appear on multiple dockets simultaneously. Shared visibility enables coordination, accountability, and situational awareness across participating roles. Information visibility varies by role to reflect real-world access boundaries where appropriate.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-8: Docket Obligations</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-8.1: Nature of Obligations - [Docketed items represent binding professional responsibilities. Obligations attach to role occupancy rather than player choice and constitute a primary source of professional pressure within gameplay.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-8.2: Time-Bound Responsibilities - [Docket obligations are subject to procedural deadlines that advance legal motion. Deadlines function as structural boundaries rather than punitive timers. When obligations are not fulfilled by the player, Sidebar may submit best-effort materials on the player’s behalf, with associated professional consequences. Deadline cadence, lock-in points, and procedural thresholds remain within studio discretion.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-8.3: Workload and Prioritization - [Players manage competing obligations across multiple cases. Effective prioritization constitutes a strategic and professional skill. Visibility and management of workload remain flexible and subject to studio-defined tools.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-9: Firm Structure & Private Practice (PPP) Case Management</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-9.1: Firm Formation and Leadership - [Any eligible private practice attorney may form a firm and act as Managing Partner. Managing Partner authority is organizational and administrative rather than judicial. Firm governance structures remain subject to studio discretion.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-9.2: Partner Qualifications and Responsibility - [Partner roles are qualification-based rather than appointment-based. Eligibility requires demonstrated capability, including sufficient Insight to perform firm-level functions. Partners share responsibility with Managing Partners for firm caseload oversight.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-9.3: Firm-Level Case Distribution - [Firms manage incoming cases through internal distribution mechanisms. Case assignment is collaborative between Managing Partners and Partners, supporting continuity and workload balance. Coordination mechanisms remain flexible and studio-defined.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-9.4: Firm Support, Continuity, and Capability - [Firms provide internal support mechanisms to preserve case continuity during staffing changes, including PPP-to-PSP transitions. Managing Partners and qualified Partners may temporarily assume Attorney of Record responsibility to maintain progression, while original attorneys may continue contributing as assisting counsel. Firm-level Sidebar capability functions as an institutional resource available to firm leadership for supervision, coordination, and continuity functions. Access to firm-level capability is role- and responsibility-scoped, preserving personal progression and eligibility requirements.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-10: Public Service Roles & Institutional Case Handling</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-10.1: Institutional Exercise of Authority - [All cases belong to the courts, regardless of the roles or affiliations of participating players. Public service roles operate as stewards of institutional authority exercised on behalf of courts and offices rather than as owners of matters. Authority derives from role occupancy within an institution and is bounded by jurisdiction and scope.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-10.2: Tenure, Turnover, and Continuity - [Public service roles are held on limited tenures or workload-based terms. Role turnover is expected and routine, reflecting the cyclical nature of public service participation. Continuity of legal motion is preserved across transitions, ensuring that institutional function does not depend on uninterrupted individual presence.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-10.3: Case Inheritance and Fallback Mechanisms - [Incoming public service role holders inherit active matters automatically and without discretion. Inheritance preserves procedural continuity and prevents interruption of legal motion. When no human replacement is immediately available, continuity mechanisms activate to maintain case progression until a qualified player assumes the role.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-10.4: Authority Boundaries and Oversight - [Public service authority is bounded by role definition, jurisdictional limits, and institutional oversight structures. Oversight functions to stabilize and correct legal processes rather than to punish participation. Specific oversight and enforcement mechanisms are defined in their dedicated exhibit.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-11: Career Loops & Role Cycling</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-11.1: Career Movement as a System Feature - [Movement between roles and professional contexts is a core structural feature of Order in the Court. Player careers are defined by cyclical and situational motion rather than linear promotion. Authority, access, and responsibility expand and contract over time as players move through different roles.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-11.2: Context Switching Between Private Practice and Public Service - [Players are expected to move between private practice (PPP) and public service (PSP) contexts throughout their careers. Participation in PSP roles represents temporary stewardship of institutional authority rather than permanent advancement. Return to private practice following public service is normal, anticipated, and non-punitive.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-11.3: Temporary Authority and Workload-Bound Roles - [Certain roles confer authority for limited scopes defined by workload or participation rather than fixed tenure. Judicial and senior PSP roles are bounded by handled matters or active responsibility. Expiration of authority returns players to broader participation without diminishing professional standing or accumulated capability.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-11.4: Career Incentives and Player Motivation - [Career loops function as a primary driver of long-term engagement. Role cycling introduces new pressures, perspectives, and responsibilities that reshape gameplay over time. Incentives, recognition, and benefits associated with role participation remain subject to studio discretion.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-11.5: Cross-Context Experience and Capability - [Experience gained in one professional context informs effectiveness in others. Cross-context participation contributes to professional capability and perspective rather than rank or entitlement. Synergies arising from varied experience remain flexible and studio-defined.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-11.6: Voluntary Withdrawal, Inactivity, and Career Stability - [Players may step back from roles or experience periods of reduced activity without immediate penalty. Withdrawal and inactivity are treated as normal phases within a professional lifecycle. Accumulated standing and Sidebar capability persist across pauses in activity.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-12: Metrics and Professional Signals</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-12.1: Sources of Metrics - [Reputation Score (RS) and Connection Score (CS) are primarily derived from case participation and case-adjacent interactions. Insight (IS) derives from research activity, progression, and optional purchases rather than case outcomes. Additional sources or modifiers affecting metrics remain subject to studio discretion.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-12.2: Reputation Score (RS) - [Reputation Score records formal professional outcomes. RS accumulation occurs throughout the lifecycle of a case, with final evaluation and adjustment applied at case resolution. RS may increase or decrease over time, including through inactivity or retirement-related adjustments governed by studio-defined lifecycle systems.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-12.3: Connection Score (CS) - [Connection Score is a pairwise metric shared between individual players. CS movement reflects personal interactions, conduct, reliability, and professional behavior, often within or adjacent to cases. A player’s overall CS represents an aggregate abstraction derived from non-neutral pairwise connections and is not strictly correlated to case outcomes.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-12.4: Insight (IS) - [Insight measures Sidebar capability rather than player knowledge. IS accumulates persistently and does not decrease, reflecting permanent expansion of Sidebar resources and access. IS influences gameplay through Sidebar behavior and the scope of resources available to the player’s Sidebar, including access parameters for MARL0.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-12.5: Metric Persistence Across Roles - [Reputation Score, Connection Score, and Insight persist across role and context changes. Metrics function as longitudinal records of professional history rather than role-bound statistics. Roles may apply, weight, or interpret metrics differently, subject to studio design.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-12.6: Asymmetric Metric Behavior - [RS, CS, and IS respond differently to success, failure, conduct, and time. This asymmetry supports diverse playstyles, strategies, and career paths. Balance, tuning, and metric interaction remain within studio discretion.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-12.7: Metrics as Rewards and Regulators - [Metrics function simultaneously as reward signals and structural regulators within the ecosystem. Increasing metrics serves as a primary source of player motivation while also governing access, eligibility, and trust. Thresholds, enforcement, and detailed consequences are deferred to studio-defined systems and dedicated exhibits.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-13: Bootstrapping & Legal Motion Continuity</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-13.1: Purpose of Bootstrapping - [Bootstrapping functions as a structural mechanism to preserve legal motion when human participation is temporarily insufficient. It exists to prevent stalled cases, empty dockets, or institutional deadlocks rather than to generate content or accelerate progression. Bootstrapping stabilizes the ecosystem without displacing player-driven activity.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-13.2: Conditions for Activation - [Bootstrapping activates when system demand exceeds available human capacity. Demand is defined by unmet docket obligations rather than player population counts or fixed schedules. Activation signals, thresholds, and evaluation methods remain subject to studio discretion.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-13.3: Bootstrap Case Handling - [Bootstrap cases originate from approved Case Profiles within the system. These profiles are consumed upon assignment and are not duplicated across firms or roles. Bootstrap handling remains consistent with existing case creation principles, including Attorney of Record gating and court-based authority attachment.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-13.4: Player Interaction and Consequence - [Players interact with bootstrap cases through the same systems and interfaces as non-bootstrap cases. Bootstrap participation constitutes real casework with valid outcomes and consequences. Rewards, visibility, and limitations associated with bootstrap cases remain subject to studio design.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-13.5: Withdrawal, Recycling, and Normalization - [Bootstrapping recedes naturally as human participation becomes sufficient to sustain legal motion. Withdrawal occurs seamlessly without disrupting active cases or player experience. Bootstrapping may reactivate during future population shifts or workload imbalances, functioning as a recyclable safety system subordinate to human-driven gameplay.]</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="cb-line">	D-14: Time Pressure, Automation, and Continuity</summary>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-14.1: Legal Time as Structural Pressure - [Legal systems within Order in the Court operate under time-bound procedural expectations. Deadlines, procedural windows, and lock-in points function as expressions of legal time rather than gameplay timers. Time pressure exists to advance legal motion and decision-making rather than to punish inactivity.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-14.2: Player Absence and System Continuity - [Players may be unavailable during active legal processes due to scheduling, role cycling, or real-world constraints. Continuity of legal motion is treated as a system responsibility rather than a player failure. The system preserves progress and posture without requiring constant presence.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-14.3: Sidebar-Mediated Automation - [When required to preserve continuity, Sidebar may submit filings or responses on a player’s behalf. Automation produces compliant, minimal outputs sufficient to prevent procedural default. Automated submission exists to preserve legal motion rather than to optimize outcomes or confer advantage.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-14.4: Preparation-Weighted Outcomes - [Automated outputs are materially influenced by prior player preparation. Research, drafting, and strategic inputs completed before absence inform Sidebar-mediated submissions. Preparation functions as the primary method for mitigating risk associated with absence and supports short-session, preparation-driven gameplay.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-14.5: Quality Degradation and Consequence - [Automated submissions may exhibit reduced quality compared to human-generated work. This degradation reflects absence rather than system error and manifests through normal case resolution. Resulting outcomes influence Reputation Score (RS) and Connection Score (CS) in accordance with standard case mechanics.]</div>
<div class="cb-subline">		D-14.6: Accountability and Attribution - [All submissions, whether human-generated or automated, are attributed to the player.
